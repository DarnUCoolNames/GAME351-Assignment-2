README File. Please provide a thorough readme file outlining what you implemented, with
additions, omissions, and known errata in your program. Indicate which “choice” components
were implemented and any new key mappings that are required for the player. Finally, include
the installation procedure for your program, as well as the rendering pipeline that you are using.
Quality of documentation is worth 10% of the grade.

1. Primary functionality 


2. Choice Features implemented


To install the project, follow these steps:

1) Create a blank "3D URP" project in Unity Hub.  
   Note: Your project MUST use the Universal 
   Rendering Pipeline for textures and effects
   to render properly.

2) Allow the Unity editor to initialize the project.
3) Save your blank 3D URP project and exit Unity.
4) Navigate to project directory in file system.
5) Drop the "Assets" and "Project Settings" folders 
   into this directory.
6) Open and reload the Unity project you created.
7) In the project navigator, go to the assets directory
   and find the "Scenes" folder.
8) Click on the "Cross-Country Scene" to load it.
7) Go to Unity->File->Build Settings and verify that
   the "Cross-Country Scene" is in the "Scenes in Build" 
   list.
8) If the scene is not in the build list, click
   "Add Open Scenes". The scene should appear checked. 
9) The game template then should be ready for building 
   and running.
